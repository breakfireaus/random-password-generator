# Random Password Generator
## Description

- Here is a Random Password Generator, written in javascript, this was created so people who use it can randomly create a password for protecting sensitive information. This was created as part of my study of javascript at Monash University Bootcamp for programming

- The problem it solves is that if you want a random password it will create it for you but not store it anywhere. 

- I got a better understanding of Javascript while working on this project.
